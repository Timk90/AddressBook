# AddressBook

(FOR EMPLOYER) Spring MVC + MyBatis + PostgreSQL +Validation and Spring security are inside. 
This is the web application using Spring MVC framework. 
Validation and security options were also added to project. 
There are two possible roles for rigistreted useres - ROLE_ADMIN and ROLE_USER (default in Spring security). 
Only two firstly added users have an opprtunity to sign-in to web site, 
any other added line two addres books doesn't provide loggining to system becuse of absence 
ROLE-MANAGEMENT during the registration process (it is in progress, at least it is just an example of 
working with Spring framework nothing more...). Builded with Maven war file is available on google disk 
(go to link of project). In order to check the functionality you firstly have to initialize DB data 
(inside the class DBhelper just start the main function), after that to visit a website as
an Admin you should use username: Timur and password 1234timk. 
To get a USER access you have to use username: Andrew and password: 1234andrew. 
For postgre a DB name is AddressBook and the user has been used "Admin" password "root1234".
